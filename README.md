Stickers designed for the #GovDesign community

All stickers are usually 45 millimetres in diameter. You can print them at some suitable online printers like Diginate or Sticker Mule. The files are native Adobe Illustrator files with type and letters rendered as outlines. So you donâ€™t need to install any fonts on your machine or the printer.
